# The Verge News Scraper

## What is this?

This serves as a back-end for my own frontend project where I wanted to learn use of [materialUI](https://ik.imagekit.io/htg3gsxgz/The_Verge/the-verge_2fs4BfFhu.png?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1656441011393) and cloned [The Verge](https://theverge.com) site.

Currently scraping latest top-news and feed-news (in search of better word). In overall, serves almost all latest news from the site.

## Todo

Frequently check that news are scraped. Assuming that The Verge might overhaul or do minor changes to their site which possibly leads to error(s) with scraping.
